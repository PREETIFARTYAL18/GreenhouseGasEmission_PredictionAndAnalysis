# üåç GreenhouseGasEmission_PredictionAndAnalysis0
This project predicts greenhouse gas emissions using machine learning techniques. Developed for AICTE Edunet Foundation, it includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization in a Google Colab

# Project Overview
Greenhouse gases are a major contributor to climate change. Predicting their future levels can help policymakers and researchers take timely actions. This notebook demonstrates the application of data science techniques to forecast emissions using real-world data.

# Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Machine Learning Model Training (e.g., Linear Regression)
Model Evaluation (R¬≤ Score, MAE)
Visualization of Predictions

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
seaborn

#  How to Run
Clone the repository

Open the notebook in Jupyter

Run all cells sequentially to see data processing, model training, and results.
